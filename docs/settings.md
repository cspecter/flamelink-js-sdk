> All the methods that you would need to work with the Flamelink "Settings" are available on the `app.settings` namespace.

---

!> Support for multiple environments and locales are currently in development. Once these exciting features are released, you will be able to set up multiple languages and streams for your development. This will allow you to have different data for "production", "staging", "development", etc.

On initialization of your Flamelink app instance, you should specify the environment you want to connect to, as well as the default locale. If no environment is specified, the default environment will be `"production"` and the locale will be `"en-US"`.

```javascript
import * as firebase from 'firebase';
import flamelink from 'flamelink';

const app = flamelink({
  ... other config ...
  env: 'production',
  locale: 'en-US'
});
```
